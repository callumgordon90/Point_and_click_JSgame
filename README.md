Genre: Fighting Video Game

Title: 'La Batalla de los superheroes mas fuertes de la Galaxia'

Languages used: javascript html and css

Description: This is an interactive video game which is based upon selecting superheroes and pitching them against one another in simulated battles, much like a card based video game.

The game consists for four screens; a start screen, a character select screen, a battle screen and an end screen. After the game finishes it resets itself. The interface is a 
simple point and click setup, and the attack damage being done in the game is calculated by an algorithm in javascript which randomly deducts value from the life bar of the opposing character, whilst simultaniously displaying a written message to the player about the damage being done. (This basic functionality was created by making a 'fighter' class in the javascript code, then developing characters as object/instances of that class, and then manipulating their statistics with object orientated programming and 'onclick' controls.

Personal comments and things to improve: In my opinion this was quite challenging as my third project, but I enjoyed doing it and I had fun experimenting with the aesthetics of the game and trying to express a little bit of my creativity with the general look and feel (music, characters, background images etc.) However, as my skills with javascript improve in the future I would like to return to this project and add more functionality - such as selectable character bios and more than one attack button. Nevetheless, it was a very useful exercise in object orientated programming to do this project.
